jscompiler-sbt is a very simple sbt 0.11 plugin for web developer using coffeescript, dust and less.
It simply watch the web folder in your src tree and compile all .coffee, .dust or .less file to the target folder.
I decided to develop my own first plugin for sbt (so this is also a little bit a learning project) and have a up to date tools with a simple design allowing quick upgade/upgrade of the script compilers.

Right now you need to clone and publish-local this project to be able to use it.
